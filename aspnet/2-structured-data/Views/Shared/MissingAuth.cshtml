<h1 class="text-danger">Missing Authentication Credentials</h1>
<p>
    Failed to call a Google API due to missing credentials.  There are two ways to provide credentials:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/">Download the Google SDK</a> and run <code>gcloud auth login.</code>
            It's Easy and convenient for testing and developing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials">
                Use Application Default Credentials
            </a>for code that's deployed to another machine.
        </li>
    </ul>
